<br>
`npm install`
<br>

installs the node modules to the file
<br>
`npm run build`

## Introduction
The goal and aim of this report is to have a clear understanding of creating a single web application using technologies such as React and Firebase, react is used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficently. Specifically this web application created is a tool used for students to be able to create a cv with assitance from the university while also being able to apply to jobs. In the first assesment a figma prototype was created, in this report we focus on creating the web application using Javascript. The reasoning for choosing this problem is because many student lack guidance when writing a cv and never know where to apply for jobs. For that reason i built a web application to encorage further support to the students . so what tools were used to develop the web application?

Throughout this the report will demonstarte the methodology that was used to implement the web application and illustarte why this application will solve the problem for students.

## Methodology
In the first assesment i explained what metholody was used to design and develop my web application the method used was the design thinking methodology which helped me make my app acessible and attainable in this assesment I have researched a development methodology that will be used throughtout the implementation of my application. The chosen methodology that was chosen is the agile development methodology.The agile methodlogy is broken up into six steps these steps include:

1. Product Vision Statement:<br>
The product vision statement describes the overaching long-term mission for the application, the goal of my web application is to encourage students to use my app to be able to guide students in creating or adapting their Cv's or looking for experience or full time jobs which is more beneficial.

2. Product Roadmap: <br>
Product Roadmap is the high-level view of the requirements needed to achieve the product vision, in this case the requirements are considered from the frist assessments where i created a survey to gather information from students. I asked relatable questions that helped me design this application in a specific way for students needs and requiremnts.

3. Product Backlog:* <br>
a product backlog contains a list of what is needed for your project.

4. Release Plan:* <br>
A timetable for the release of a working product.

5. Sprint Backlog:* <br>
The user stories comes 
The user stories (requirements), goals, and tasks linked to the current sprint.

6. Increment: <br>
Increment is the final piece where the working product functionality is presented and at the end of the sprint it will be given to the customer. The finalaised working application can be found here "https://github.com/KayleighPerera/COM623_AE2.git" and can be run at "/localhost3000"

## User story
The aim of my user story is for a user to be able to 

## Conclusion/Results
By all counts and well proven results, i have learnt the purpose of using React and Fiebase in Javascript to solve a problem for students. I specifcally created a web application to give students more guidance when writing a cv or looking for a job. Using a development methodology called the agile methodology i created a application using Javascipt while also using the design thinking methodology from the first assesment which guided me in creating as well as adapting my design.
