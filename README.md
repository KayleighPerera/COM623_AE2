## Introduction
The goal and aim of this report is to have a clear understanding of creating a single web application using technologies such as React and Firebase, react is used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficently. Specifically this web application created is a tool used for students to be able to create a cv with assitance from the university while also being able to apply to jobs. In the first assesment a figma prototype was created, in this report we focus on creating the web application using Javascript. The reasoning for choosing this problem is because many student lack guidance when writing a cv and never know where to apply for jobs. For that reason i built a web application to encorage further support to the students . so what tools were used to develop the web application?

Throughout this the report will demonstarte the methodology that was used to implement the web application and illustarte why this application will solve the problem for students.

## Methodology
In the first assesment i explained what metholody was used to design and develop my web application the method used was the design thinking methodology which helped me make my app acessible and attainable in this assesment I have researched a development methodology that will be used throughtout the implementation of my application. The chosen methodology that was chosen is the agile development methodology.The agile methodlogy is broken up into six steps these steps include:
1. Product Vision Statement
2. Product Roadmap
3.Product Backlog
4. Release Plan
5. Sprint Backlog
6. Increment
